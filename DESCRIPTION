Description: The package implements the unadjusted and covariate-adjusted methods (ANCOVA, ANHECOVA, AIPW) for estimating the average treatment effect in randomized clinical trials, combining with a number of variable selection procedures (Lasso, adaptive Lasso, marginal correlation and pre-testing). Three methods dealing with missing data are included, which are complete-case analysis (cc), multiple imputation by chain equations (mice), and missingness indicator imputation (miss-ind). The miss-ind method allows missing in covariates only.
