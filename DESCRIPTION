Description: The package implements unadjusted (Simple) and covariate-adjusted methods (ANCOVA, ANHECOVA, AIPW) for estimating the average treatment effect in randomized clinical trials, combined with various variable selection procedures (Lasso, adaptive Lasso, marginal correlation, and pre-testing). Five methods for handling missing data are included.
