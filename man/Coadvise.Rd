\usage{
Coadvise(
  y,
  A,
  X = NA,
  var.sel.method = "Lasso",
  lasso.family = "gaussian",
  A.lasso.family = "gaussian",
  out1.model.aipw = "linear",
  out0.model.aipw = "linear",
  k = 1,
  xi = 0.25,

}
\arguments{
\item{y}{vector of outcome}

\item{A}{vector of treatment (binary, valued from 0 and 1)}

\item{X}{matrix of covariates or vector of a univariate covariate}

\item{var.sel.method}{variable selection method:
`No` (use all covariates without selection), `Lasso` (default), `A.Lasso`,
`Corr.k` (select k covariates with highest correlations with the outcome; k is between 1 and number of covariates),
`Corr.xi` (select all covariates with correlation > xi with the outcome; xi is between 0 and 1),
`Pre.test` (preliminary test on each single covariate)}

\item{lasso.family}{glm model family for Lasso (`Lasso`) variable selection based on outcome type, chosen from `gaussian`, `binomial`, `poisson`, and `multinomial`; default is `gaussian`}

\item{A.lasso.family}{glm model family for adaptive Lasso (`A.Lasso`) variable selection based on outcome type, chosen from `gaussian`, `binomial`, `poisson`, and `multinomial`; default is `gaussian`}

\item{out1.model.aipw}{model for E(Y(1)|X) in AIPW estimator. We allow the use of the following models:
for continuous outcome (but can also for other types): `linear` (the linear model);
for binary outcome: `logit`, `probit`, `log`, `cloglog`, `identity`;
for categorical outcome more than two categories: `poisson`, `multilogi` (multinomial logistic), `ordlogi` (ordinal logistic)}

\item{out0.model.aipw}{model for E(Y(0)|X) in AIPW estimator. Same argument choices as `out1.model.aipw`}

\item{k}{number of selected covariates, only if the `Corr.k` variable selection method is used; default is `1`}

\item{xi}{threshold of marginal correlation, only if the `Corr.xi` variable selection method is used; default is `0.25`}

\item{pre.alpha}{confidence (significance) level of preliminary test; default is `0.05` (for a 0.95 confidence interval)}

\item{conf.level}{confidence (significance) level of confidence interval of the ATE; default is `0.05` (for a 0.95 confidence interval)}

\item{seed}{seed for generating random numbers, when using Lasso or adaptive Lasso; default is `4399`}
